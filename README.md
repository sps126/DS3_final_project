This repository contains files used for my final project in Data Science three. My project focused on examining the the variables that influence a teams basketball game outcome. This repository is structured into four main folders:

* **data**, which contains the data downloaded from the [Googles March Madness Compeition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2023) as well as the proccessed datasets.
* **code**, which contains all the relevant scripts for preprocessing and analysis.
* **output**, which contains  the final report of this project.
